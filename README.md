# [Based on Argon React Native](https://creativetimofficial.github.io/argon-react-native/docs/#) [![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social&logo=twitter)](https://twitter.com/home?status=Argon%20React%20Native,%20a%20cool%20Argon%20React%20Native%20App%20Template%20%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%20https%3A//bit.ly/2KAj86H%20%23reactnative%20%23argon%20%23designsystem%20%23developers%20via%20%40CreativeTim)

Argon React Native is a fully coded app template built over [Galio.io](https://galio.io/?ref=creativetim), [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/?ref=creativetim) and [Expo](https://expo.io/?ref=creativetim) to allow you to create powerful and beautiful e-commerce mobile applications. We have redesigned all the usual components in Galio to make it look like Argon's Design System, minimalistic and easy to use.

Start your development with a badass Design System for React Native inspired by Argon Design System. If you like Argon's Design System, you will love this react native app template! It features a huge number of components and screens built to fit together and look amazing. 

## FULLY CODED COMPONENTS

Argon React Native features over 200 variations of components like buttons, inputs, cards, navigations etc, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify inside our theme file.

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented. We wanted the design process to be seamless, so switching from image to the real page is very easy to do.


## Documentation
The documentation for the Argon React Native is hosted at our [website](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-react-native/docs/).


## Installation

Make sure you have npm/yarn installed. After you've installed any of those, install expo by writing the following in your terminal console: npm install -g expo-cli (or yarn global add expo-cli , whichever you prefer).

Now you're all set up. Navigate your way into the project's directory and write npm install or yarn install. This will install all dependencies that Argon React Native needs in order to function properly.

Now write expo start and you're ready to go. A new window will pop-up in your default browser. This is your localhost's dashboard. Open up your favorite text editor/IDE and an Android/iOS simulator.
